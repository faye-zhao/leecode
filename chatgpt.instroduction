I am a highly experienced software engineer with over 10 years work experiances in web technologies, 
specializing in both front-end as well as back-end development. 

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with leading companies like 
Aurora Innovation, Credit Karma, SurveyMonkey, Mint (Intuit), and Yahoo, where I developed 
scalable applications and innovative data visualization tools. 

My expertise spans various industries, including AI, FinTech, and SaaS, with a strong focus on 
leveraging technologies such as React/Typescirpt/MaterialUI, Node.j ThreeJS and D3. 

I thrive in collaborative environments, and aligning technical solutions with 
business goals. My analytical and problem-solving skills enable me to drive projects 
to successful completion, ensuring a seamless user experience and optimal performance.

 1. Describe a challenging situation at work and how you handled it.

Situation: 
    At Aurora Innovation, we faced a significant challenge when refactoring and integrating complex labeling tood into our visualization platform as one of the feature plugins.

Task: 
    My role was to lead the development of refactoring and integration of the labeling tool while ensuring they were user-friendly and effectively communicated the data.

Action: 
    I collaborated closely with PM and UX designers to understand their product requirement and figma design deeply. I organized brainstorming sessions to gather input on key visualization needs and 
    implemented a series of prototypes using ThreeJS and D3 to ensure that the tools were intuitive. Regular feedback loops with inernal and external users helped us refine our approach.

Result: 
    The final product not only met our initial goals but also received positive feedback from users for its clarity and usability. This led to a obsoletion of old labeling tool.  
    The tool can be used among our internal teams, enhancing their workflow significantly. Later it gets exposed to thousands of external users/labelers abroad.  

2. Give an example of a time when you had to work with a difficult team member.

Situation: 
    While at Credit Karma, I worked with a team member who had a very different approach to project timelines and deliverables, leading to conflicts during a critical project.

Task: 
    I needed to ensure the project stayed on track while maintaining a positive team dynamic.

Action: 
    I scheduled a one-on-one meeting to understand their perspective better. We discussed our differing work styles and agreed on a compromise where I would provide more frequent 
    updates on our progress. We also established a shared project timeline that incorporated their input.

Result: 
     This improved our collaboration and communication significantly. The project was completed on time, and we developed a mutual respect that enhanced our teamwork in subsequent projects.

3. Tell me about a time when you failed and what you learned from it.

Situation: 
    During my time at SurveyMonkey, I led a project to develop a new data visualization product. Midway through, I realized that I had underestimated the complexity of integrating 
    the existing infrastructure.

Task: 
    I needed to find a way to get back on track without derailing the entire project.

Action: 
    I quickly convened the team to reassess our project plan. We conducted a thorough risk assessment and decided to pivot some of our approaches. I took ownership of the miscalculation 
    and communicated openly with stakeholders about the adjustments needed.

Result: 
     We successfully launched the product with a minor delay, but the outcome was a robust system that exceeded initial performance expectations. This experience taught me the importance 
     of thorough planning and the value of transparency with my team and stakeholders.

4. Can you describe a project you managed from start to finish?

Situation: 
    At Mint, I was tasked with rebuilding the financial charting library into a single-page application to improve performance.

Task: 
    I needed to manage the entire development process, from initial design to deployment, while coordinating with multiple teams.

Action: 
    I led the architecture discussions, 
        designed the user interface with Material UI, and 
        implemented the back-end logic using Node.js and D3 for data visualizations. 
    I also organized regular check-ins to keep everyone aligned and address any issues promptly.

Result: 
    The new SPA drastically improved loading times and user satisfaction scores, leading to a 30% increase in engagement with our financial tools.

5. Have you ever had to make a quick decision? What was it and what was the outcome?

Situation: 
    At Aurora Innovation, we encountered a bug in our visualization tool just before a critical demonstration to stakeholders.

Task: 
    I had to decide whether to attempt a quick fix on the spot or to revert to a previous stable version.

Action: 
    After assessing the situation, I quickly decided to implement a temporary fix that wouldn’t impact our core functionality while communicating transparently with the stakeholders 
    about the situation. I also set up a follow-up meeting to address any concerns after the demo.

Result: 
    The demo went smoothly, and stakeholders appreciated our honesty and ability to adapt. We fixed the bug shortly after, and the project continued without any major setbacks.
